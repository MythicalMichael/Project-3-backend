TO DO

##Error Handlers 404 500 ----backend for 400 500 kinda finished----
for Signup if you signin redirect to flats(homepage) BEAUTIFUL IMAGE OF PENGUIN
if you are not logged you are not able to do anything with our app because it is
classidied only for Ironhackers!!

##Signup link for Login if you signup redirect to set up Profile ----check----

##Homepage appears when user logs in user can see a long list of all available ----check----
flats

##Edit Models change User Flat ----lalaal----

##Log out a user should be able to log out by pressing a button in the navbar ----kinda done----
and he will be redirected to the login page

##Set up your profile ----add more inputs otherwise done----

huge Form for info name,age,country,preferences,gender save button to save in db

##ADD flat Form info location pictures ... save and post to /flat (homepage) ----half way through----

upload done and name... location is next

##flat id you can see details of the flat and the flatmates differentiate
between owner and piiipol who joined join button to request Owner will get a
request with your message which he can either decline or accept if he accepts
then you will become a flatmate also contact info of the owner will be shown
otherwise you will be rejected and you get his message(message maybe we can
leave it if we have not enough time)
logic should be you by clicking button set your status to pending
and the admin sets your status to either accepted or reject if you can
apply for many flats then the models should be updated so you need flat ids and user ids who wants to join
then push into flatmates array
if rejected you should not be able to apply again to the same flat
userprofile /user/:id

Probably you will be able to aply only for one flat maybe it can turn out to hard for more
not sure though

\*very nice would be a chatbox
---is there is page for that now displays only the flatname---

##user/me you will be able to see the flat you joined and which you have created
here you should be able to edit your profile which is also available to other
people

##user/:id you can also look up other peoples profiles to get an impression ----working on----
you can access authors profile by clicking on him

##set up DB ----check----

##Flat logic
there is should be expiring date on flats so and they should also disappear if flatmates array full \*only be visible for you at the top of the page if you are flatmate
